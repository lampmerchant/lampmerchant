### About This Tashtari...

Hi, I'm Tashtari!

I'm very interested in retrocomputing, particularly with classic Macintosh computers, and most of my projects pertain to this.  I am active on the [68kMLA](https://68kmla.org/bb/index.php?members/tashtari.20274/) forum.

Below, you'll find a selection of my favorite projects; there are more under the [repositories](https://github.com/lampmerchant?tab=repositories) tab.
